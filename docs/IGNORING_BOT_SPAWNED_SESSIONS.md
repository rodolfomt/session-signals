# Ignoring machine-spawned sessions

Some tooling launches Claude Code in headless mode (`claude --print`) in the
background. Those runs are real sessions — they carry a normal `session_id` and
no `agent_id`, so Session Signals cannot tell them apart from your own work and
shows them as ordinary rows. If you run such tooling, the widget fills with
sessions you never started and the tray colours for work you aren't doing.

`ignore_rules` lets you hide them.

> **Session Signals ships with no ignore rules at all.** Nothing is hidden until

## Where the rules live

In the Session Signals store (`beacon.json` in the app config dir), under
`config.ignore_rules`.

## Managing rules in Settings

Everything on this page is also reachable from **Settings → Session
filtering**, without hand-editing `beacon.json`:

- **Hide these sessions** — an editable list of `ignore_rules`. Add a rule,
  pick its kind (`first prompt starts` / `cwd contains`), type the value.
  Changes save automatically (debounced while typing).
- **Never hide these** — the `never_hide` list, editable the same way. The
  section states the precedence in the UI, not just here: **`never_hide`
  always wins** — a session matching both lists stays visible.
- **Always treated as yours (built in)** — the four Claude Code interaction
  markers (`<command-…>`, `<local-command-…>`, `<ide_opened_file>`,
  `<ide_selection>`) that are never observed or proposed. Shown greyed, with
  no delete affordance — they're immutable by design (see "What Session
  Signals records" below).
- **Hidden right now** — an audit list of every currently-hidden session
  paired with the rule that's hiding it, plus the reveal-on-block count. This
  is what makes the tray colour verifiable: it always matches exactly what
  the widget is *not* showing.
- **The suggested-filter card** — see "Suggested filters" below; it's the
  same `list_proposals`/`accept_proposal`/`dismiss_proposal`/
  `never_suggest_proposal` flow, rendered as one card at a time.
- A quiet tray line ("Session filtering: N suggestion…") appears only when a
  proposal is waiting and opens Settings scrolled to this section when
  clicked — it never changes the tray icon or colour, which always encodes
  rollup state only.

One caveat the UI can't work around: accepting a `never_hide` entry (or
writing one by hand) only keeps *new* observations out of the store —
fingerprints already recorded before the entry existed remain (hashes are
one-way, so there's no reversing one back to text to purge it after the
fact). The **Clear observations** button in this section is the full reset if
you want to be sure nothing from before is still counted.

## Rule kinds

### `first_prompt_prefix` — match the session's opening prompt

```jsonc
{ "kind": "first_prompt_prefix", "value": "IMPORTANT: You are running in non-interactive" }
```

Hides a session whose **first** prompt starts with this text (case-insensitive,
leading whitespace ignored). This is the reliable one: a spawner injects a fixed
instruction, and that opening identifies it.

It is deliberately **anchored to the first prompt**, so a session where *you*
merely mention the phrase later is never hidden.

Sessions that open with one of Claude Code's own interaction markers —
`<command-…>`, `<local-command-…>`, `<ide_opened_file>`, `<ide_selection>` — are
never matched. Those mean a human typed a slash command or opened a file, so a
long autonomous run you started with `/some-command` stays visible.

### `cwd_contains` — match the working directory

```jsonc
{ "kind": "cwd_contains", "value": "ecc-homunculus" }
```

Hides a session whose working directory contains this substring
(case-insensitive). Convenient when a spawner uses its own scratch directory.

**Use with care.** A directory rule cannot separate machine sessions from your
own when both run in the same folder — which is common, since background tooling
often analyses the repo you're working in. Prefer `first_prompt_prefix`.

## Keeping your own openings out (`never_hide`)

Session Signals also **observes** which session openings repeat, so it can
eventually offer you a ready-made `first_prompt_prefix`/`cwd_contains` rule
built from a pattern it actually saw — instead of you having to write one by
hand from the recipe below. `never_hide` is how you keep specific openings of
your own out of that observation entirely, and — **`never_hide` always
wins** — out of `ignore_rules` too, even if a rule would otherwise hide them.

```jsonc
"never_hide": [
  { "kind": "first_prompt_prefix", "value": "please review the listener" },
  { "kind": "cwd_contains", "value": "my-personal-scratch-repo" }
]
```

Same two matcher shapes as `ignore_rules`, same precedence logic — but
inverted: a `never_hide` match makes a session visible (or keeps it visible)
regardless of what `ignore_rules` says about the same cwd or prompt. If a
prefix appears in both lists, the session stays **visible**. This fails open
on purpose: extra noise in the widget is recoverable, a session you needed
that silently vanished isn't.

### What Session Signals records

With observation on (`observe_enabled`, on by default), Session Signals reads
each session's first prompt once and stores a **salted hash** of its opening —
never the prompt text itself. Concretely, per distinct opening: a few
128-bit fingerprints (one per tracked prefix length), a count, and first/last-seen
timestamps. Records older than `observe_retain_days` (30 by default) are
pruned automatically. `grep`-ing `beacon.json` for anything you typed will
never find it.

Honest limitation: hashing a short, low-entropy prompt is not anonymity
against someone who can hash a dictionary of candidate strings. What it
defeats is a readable prompt log sitting in JSON that could get synced,
backed up, or attached to a bug report.

An opening a human marker precedes — a slash command, `<ide_opened_file>`,
`<ide_selection>` — is never observed either, on the same reasoning as the
`ignore_rules` anchoring above: those are evidence of you at the keyboard, not
a repeatable machine pattern.

Set `observe_enabled: false` to turn observation off entirely; existing
records are left alone until you clear them.

### A hidden session that blocks on you always reappears

If a session hidden by `ignore_rules` ever needs you — a permission prompt, a
plan to approve — it is un-hidden **until it restarts**, notifies like any
other session, and colours the tray red. This is a safety valve, not a bug:
a filter is a guess about what's machine-spawned, and a guess should never be
allowed to swallow a request for you specifically. A genuine restart
(`SessionStart`) clears the reveal, so the rule applies normally again from
the next run.

## Suggested filters

Instead of writing a rule by hand, Session Signals can offer you one built from
a pattern it actually observed. `list_proposals` returns every eligible
cluster — an opening seen at least `propose_threshold` times (3 by default,
floored at 3 in code) — highest count first, each with its readable sample
text and the currently-visible sessions that would disappear on accept.

Three actions, none of them automatic:

- **Accept** (`accept_proposal`) — writes the sample as a `first_prompt_prefix`
  entry in `ignore_rules`. Idempotent: accepting twice writes one rule.
- **Dismiss** (`dismiss_proposal`) — "not now," this run only. The proposal
  reappears once the cluster grows past its count at dismissal.
- **Never suggest** (`never_suggest_proposal`) — adds the sample to
  `never_hide` *and* purges every fingerprint whose live sample is
  prefix-related to it from the observation store, so it stops surfacing
  again this run. A record with no live sample (carried over from a previous
  run) can't be matched to that family and may still exist on disk — hashes
  are one-way, so a purge can never be total across a restart.
  `clear_observations` is the full reset if you want one.

Nothing is applied without one of these three actions — a proposal sitting
unaddressed changes nothing.

### Minimum sample length — and what it's based on

A cluster's sample must be at least **60 characters** to be proposal-eligible
(`config::MIN_PROPOSE_SAMPLE_LEN`). That number is measured, not guessed.

**How it was measured.** A sweep (`src-tauri/tests/prefix_sweep.rs`, `#[ignore]`d
by default) walked a local `~/.claude/projects`-shaped tree, resolving each
session's opening through the same `descriptor::first_prompt` the app uses. For
every hypothetical prefix length from 4 to 120 it grouped openings by
fingerprint and counted the **mixed** clusters — groups containing both a
human-marked and an unmarked opening, i.e. the case where a prefix has stopped
telling your sessions apart from a machine's.

Run 2026-07-30: **756** transcripts walked, **568** resolved an opening (21
human-marked, 547 unmarked); 9 of the 568 (~1.6%) are naturally under 60
characters.

| prefix length | clusters | mixed |
|----:|---------:|------:|
| 4–6 | 7 | 1 |
| 8 | 13 | **5 (peak)** |
| 9–17 | 10–12 | 4 |
| 18–25 | 9–10 | 2–3 |
| 26–56 | 9–10 | 1 |
| **57–120** | 8 | **0** |

Mixed clusters occur at every length from 4 through 56, peaking at 8 characters
(where a fifth of all clusters mixed polarities), then drop to zero at 57 and
stay there for the entire remaining range — 64 consecutive lengths. 60 is the
shortest length Session Signals already tracks for longer prompts, so adopting
it as the floor sits safely past that knee without introducing a second,
unrelated constant. It closes the one real gap: a naturally-short prompt is
otherwise sampled at its own length with no floor at all.

**What this does not establish.** The `mixed` metric counts clusters mixing a
*marked* human opening with an unmarked one — but marked openings are never
observed in the first place, so they can never form a real cluster at any
length; the sweep sees them only because it runs outside that guard. The risk
this floor actually exists to reduce — **your own unmarked opening repeating
and colliding with a machine's** — is by construction invisible to `mixed`, because
two unmarked openings colliding is a homogeneous cluster, not a mixed one. The
knee is real evidence that mixed-polarity collisions stop at 57 characters; it
is not evidence about same-polarity collisions. It is also a single-developer
local corpus, not a cross-user sample.

One consequence, now measured rather than assumed: a spawner whose injected
opening is itself under 60 characters can never be proposed, at any cluster
size. No automatic (machine-spawned) opening in this corpus falls below 90
characters, so the 60-char floor clears every machine opening by a
30-character margin — the recall cost against machine traffic is measured
zero on this corpus, not merely assumed from both known ECC families being
long.

The raw record (full per-length table, method, and both Phase 6 measurements)
is kept with the project's internal notes rather than published here; the sweep
itself is reproducible with
`BEACON_CORPUS=<path> cargo test --test prefix_sweep -- --ignored --nocapture`.

Two honest caveats:

- **A cluster that crossed the threshold entirely in a previous run
  surfaces only after one more matching session re-supplies the sample
  text.** The count is persisted; the readable sample is not (see "What
  Session Signals records" above). This is a delay, not a loss — the
  alternative was persisting plaintext.
- **The preview list (`matching`) can be shorter than `count`.** `count`
  groups on the whitespace-normalized opening; the rule a proposal writes is
  a literal prefix, and only sessions live *right now* can appear in the
  preview. Seeing fewer rows than the count is expected, not a bug.

## Recipe: ECC (`continuous-learning` / homunculus observer)

The [ECC plugin](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) spawns `claude -p` for two
background jobs. Both use fixed openings, so one rule each is enough:

```jsonc
"ignore_rules": [
  { "kind": "first_prompt_prefix", "value": "IMPORTANT: You are running in non-interactive" },
  { "kind": "first_prompt_prefix", "value": "Below is a conversation log from a Claude Code" }
]
```

Source of those strings, if you want to verify them against your installed
version:

- `skills/continuous-learning-v2/agents/observer-loop.sh` — the instinct observer
- `scripts/lib/llm-summary.js` — the session summariser (calls `claude -p` directly)

Optionally add the scratch directory, which also catches observer runs before
their first prompt is written:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "cwd_contains", "value": "ecc-homunculus" }
```

## Writing a rule for other tooling

1. Find the session in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.jsonl`.
2. Read its first `user` (or `queue-operation`) record — that's the opening prompt.
3. Take a distinctive **leading** fragment, long enough not to collide with
   anything you'd type yourself.
4. Add it as a `first_prompt_prefix` rule.

Prefer a longer prefix over a shorter one. `"IMPORTANT:"` alone would hide any
session that happens to begin that way, including yours.

## Behaviour of hidden sessions

Hidden sessions are still tracked — they simply never reach the widget list, never
colour the tray, and never raise a notification. Remove the rule and they reappear
immediately; no state is lost.

## Turning it off

Set `ignore_rules` to `[]`. That is also the shipped default.
