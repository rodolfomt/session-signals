//! Notification engine: fire OS notifications on state *transitions* only.
//!
//! `lib.rs` calls `fire` whenever the engine reports a session changed state.
//! Because we only ever act on a real transition (the engine emits one only
//! when `from != to`), a permission prompt that simply *stays* in Needs-you
//! never re-notifies. On top of that we debounce identical (session, state)
//! transitions within a short window to collapse rapid storms.
